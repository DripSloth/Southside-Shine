### 1. Mastering the Cayo Perico Heist

**Step-by-Step:**

1. **Unlock & Prepare:**
    
    - **Purchase the Kosatka Submarine:** This is your mobile heist base. If you haven’t already, invest in it from the Maze Bank website.
    - **Upgrade your gear:** Equip high-damage weapons, plenty of body armour, and a silenced sniper or assault rifle for stealth.  

2. **Plan Your Approach:**
    
    - **Scout the island:** Use your Kosatka’s planning board to review the layout. Decide between a stealthy or aggressive approach.
    - **Target prioritization:** Aim for high-value items like the Panther Statue. A stealth approach minimizes alert levels and speeds up your run.  
        _(Example: Solo runs typically net you around $1.5–$1.6 million if you grab the Panther Statue.)_
        
3. **Execution:**
    
    - **Deploy from your Kosatka:** Choose a fast boat or helicopter drop point.
    - **Follow the optimal route:** Move quickly through marked areas, neutralize key enemies, and grab the loot.
    - **Escape:** Once you have the loot, stick to the planned escape route to avoid excessive firefight delays.

4. **Sell the Loot:**
    
    - **Head back to your Kosatka:** Complete the heist and sell your loot at the designated drop-off for a quick payout.

### 2. Leveraging Agency & VIP Work

**Step-by-Step:**

5. **Get an Office & Register as CEO:**
    
    - **Purchase an office** (Maze Bank Executive Offices are popular choices). This grants you access to CEO benefits.
    - **Register as a CEO/VIP:** Use your office computer to access VIP missions.

6. **Start Quick Missions:**
    
    - **Select Payphone Hits or Dr. Dre Contracts:** These missions are fast (around 8–10 minutes) and yield decent payouts (e.g., an 85k bonus on a payphone hit with the right conditions).
    - **Join an Invite-Only Session:** This minimizes interference from griefers and keeps your mission flow smooth.
    - _(Example: Run a payphone hit, then immediately switch to a Dr. Dre mission once the first mission’s cooldown ends.)_  

7. **Optimize Routing:**
    
    - **Set your spawn location near your office or a safe property:** This saves travel time between missions.
    - **Keep your loadout efficient:** Minimal weapon swaps and clear objectives help maintain mission speed.

### 3. Building Passive Income with Businesses

**Step-by-Step:**

8. **Invest in a Passive Business:**
    
    - **Pick a business:** Bunkers, Nightclubs, and Acid Labs are great for continuous revenue.
    - **Purchase & Upgrade:** Invest in essential upgrades (e.g., equipment and staff upgrades for bunkers) to maximize output.
    - _(Example: For a bunker, opt to buy supplies rather than stealing them to ensure consistent production without delays.)_

9. **Maintain and Resupply:**
    
    - **Regularly check your stock:** Log in periodically to sell accumulated product, preferably during bonus events for extra GTA$.
    - **Plan your sales:** Monitor in-game notifications for events like double or triple money weeks.

10. **Integration with Other Businesses:**
    
    - **Link businesses:** For instance, your nightclub can aggregate product from various operations. Ensure all passive income businesses are “running” and not idle.
    - _(Example: While you’re busy with VIP work, your nightclub silently racks up passive earnings.)_

### 4. Mixing in Heists and Mini-Heists

**Step-by-Step:**

11. **Schedule Diverse Sessions:**
    
    - **Alternate between major heists (like Diamond Casino) and mini-heists (like the Autoshop customer car mini-heist):**
        - **For Diamond Casino Heist:** Learn the setup missions. Practice with a friend or in a trusted session until you master the route.
        - **For Mini-Heists:** These are shorter and allow for a quick cash boost between longer sessions.

12. **Execution Tips:**
    
    - **Fast travel:** Use a fast vehicle (e.g., an Oppressor Mk II) to quickly switch between missions.
    - **Minimize downtime:** If one mission’s cooldown is active, immediately switch to another activity to keep your cash flow steady.
    - _(Example: After finishing a payphone hit, queue up for an Autoshop mini-heist to diversify your income stream.)_

### 5. Capitalizing on Weekly Bonuses and Events

**Step-by-Step:**

13. **Stay Informed:**
    
    - **Check update websites:** Regularly monitor sources like Polygon and GTA BOOM for the latest weekly bonuses.
    - **Plan ahead:** Note which missions or businesses are offering 2x or 3x rewards.
14. **Schedule Your Gameplay:**
    
    - **Align your sessions with bonus events:** For example, if payphone hits are doubled, focus on them until the event ends.
    - **Combine tasks:** While waiting for cooldowns in one activity, shift to another that’s currently boosted.
15. **Maximize Earnings:**
    
    - **Double-dip:** Use bonus events to resupply and then sell your passive business products for maximum profit.
    - _(Example: During a 3x GTA$ event on VIP missions, run multiple payphone hits in a row before switching back to your passive income setup.)_
