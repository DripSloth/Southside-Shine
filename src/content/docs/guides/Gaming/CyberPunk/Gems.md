    Act 2 - When you ambush Panam's former partner Nash:
    
    NOTE: You also get the second car if you don’t give in to Panam's vengeful antics
    
    After you clean out his goons, you find the car in the tunnel behind the compound (in an open shipping container)

    - 614: Look for a fenced area with a garage door being guarded by two turrets. Dispatch the turrets, get into the garage.
    - 615: Look for a small light blue fluorescent sign saying “Dime a Duzz,” it’s a shop entrance, stuff’s inside.
    - 616: There’s a road going underground. In this tunnel, there’s a wrecked car and a body near it.
    - 617: Southwest – Fenced area with barbed wire on top. There are two flying drones patrolling around a dead body.
    - 618: There’s a small stairwell, with a fluorescent arrow sign pointing left. There’s a dead body almost directly underneath the sign.
    - 620: North – Look for red shipping containers, and a large blue wall leading away from them to the left. Go into the alleyway, the third garage door will be locked behind a Body requirement.
    - 621: Northeast – Large storage area, look for a huge white 2 with “NO ENTRY” under that. There’s a dead body under it.
    - 622: Southeast – Like any normal maintenance area, it has lots of pipes, fences, metal bars, and turrets. Hardcore parkour your way up top, there’s a lootable container at the top.
    - 631: Northeast – There will be a tall antennae tower (tall metal tower with a satellite dish on top, standing on a building). Reach the top.
    - 632: East – You need to have finished 623 Assault in Progress, which appears in Kabuki, Watson, in the same area as this Hidden Gem. For reference, it would be North of the Allen St. South fast travel station. There will be a stairway leading down to water, and nearby will be an opening with a big pipe in it. Head inside.
    - 633: East – The top of this building is surrounded by fencing, with a few manmade shelters inside. There’s a fenced pathway leading to it from another building. There’s a body on a couch inside one of the shelters.
    - 634: East – Homeless camp under the highway, loot a dead body laying in the open.
    - 635: East – Look for a giant white pipe with steam coming out. You want to get on the same level as this pipe’s opening. There should be air conditioners and vents around the pipe on this building, and there is a shack on the roof here. Loot the body inside.
    - 636: East – Big white or tan footbridge, go inside and all the way up, there’s a body at the end.
    - 637: Northeast – Look for a big blue building. On one side is a path with a bunch of shops, and on the other side of it is a dark area with air conditioners, and in between those is a safe.
    - 638: Northeast – There’s a whole bunch of scaffolding making a tower up the wall. There’s a body at the bottom and a suitcase at the top. Highly recommend double jumping for this, because I got stuck numerous times inside the scaffolding.
    - 639: Northeast – You need to complete Side Gig 07 Woman of La Mancha to find this. There’s going to be a food booth at the top floor of the Kabuki Market, by the elevator, with a small flight of stairs near it that goes up to a road. Near this food stand is a dumpster with a body behind it.
    - 640: Northeast – You need to complete Side Gig 07 Woman of La Mancha to find this, and making sure you know about Anna Hamill’s location by either paying or threatening Imad, then waiting 48 hrs. There’s an area of Kabuki Market with a lot of food booths in it, surrounded by buildings with a large white staircase. There’s a body on it.
    - 641: Northeast – There’s a small river between the buildings and a road that leads to a little pond at the end. Dive in! There’s a body down here and if you’re lucky, a glitched cat!
    - 642: East – Look for a large white pipe high up. There is a staircase leading up to it near where steam comes out of it. Follow the pathway, keep making your way toward some shoddy roofs and the back of a large billboard, there’s a body here.
