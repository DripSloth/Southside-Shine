For a system with a 9th gen Intel Core i5, AMD 7800 XT, 32GB RAM, and a 1080p monitor, you can enjoy **Cyberpunk 2077** with very high graphical fidelity. Below are some recommended settings to strike a balance between performance and visual quality at 1080p resolution:

  

## Adrenaline

---

**1. Enable Radeon Super Resolution (RSR):** RSR is a spatial upscaling technology that improves performance while maintaining image quality.

- **How to enable**:
    1. Go to **Gaming > Cyberpunk 2077** (or add it manually if not detected).
    2. Enable **Radeon Super Resolution** under Graphics settings.
    3. Set your in-game resolution slightly lower than native (e.g., 1600x900), and RSR will upscale it to 1080p.

**2. Use AMD FidelityFX CAS (Contrast Adaptive Sharpening):** Enhances sharpness and clarity in-game.

- **How to enable**:
    1. Go to **Graphics Settings** in Adrenalin.
    2. Enable **Radeon Image Sharpening** and set the intensity slider between **40%–80%**.

**3. Enable Anti-Lag:** Reduces input latency, making controls more responsive.

- **How to enable**:
    1. Under **Graphics**, toggle **Radeon Anti-Lag** to **On**.

**4. Activate Smart Access Memory (SAM):** Unlocks full GPU memory for your CPU, increasing performance in compatible games.

- **How to enable**:
    1. Ensure SAM is enabled in your BIOS (look for “Resizable BAR” or “Above 4G Decoding”).
    2. In Adrenalin, go to **Performance > Tuning > Advanced Settings**.
    3. Confirm that **Smart Access Memory** is enabled.

**5. Adjust Chill, Boost, and Frame Rate Target Control:** Helps manage power usage and smooths gameplay.

- **How to enable**:
    1. Enable **Radeon Chill** and set a **Min/Max FPS** range (e.g., 60–120 FPS) to save power and reduce heat during less demanding scenes.
    2. Use **Radeon Boost** to dynamically lower resolution during fast movement to maintain smooth frame rates.
    3. Set **Frame Rate Target Control (FRTC)** to limit FPS to your monitor’s refresh rate (e.g., 60 FPS for 60Hz).

**6. Optimize Texture and Shader Cache:** Reduces stuttering by preloading shaders.

- **How to enable**:
    1. Under **Graphics Settings**, enable **Shader Cache**.
    2. Clear the cache occasionally for better performance after driver updates.

**7. Set Enhanced Sync (Optional):** Reduces screen tearing without the input lag of traditional V-Sync.

- **How to enable**:
    1. In Adrenalin, go to **Graphics > Wait for Vertical Refresh**.
    2. Set it to **Enhanced Sync**.

**8. Overclock or Undervolt (Optional):** Boosts performance or lowers power consumption.

- **How to enable**:
    1. Under **Performance > Tuning**, enable **GPU Tuning**.
    2. Increase the **GPU Clock Speed** slightly (start with +5%) and test stability.
    3. Alternatively, undervolt to reduce heat and maintain stable performance.

  

These Adrenalin settings, combined with in-game optimizations, should provide smooth and visually stunning gameplay at 1080p! Test different settings to find what works best for you.

  

## In-Game

### Graphics Settings:

- **Display Mode**: Fullscreen (for better performance)
- **Resolution**: 1920x1080 (native 1080p)
- **V-Sync**: Off (unless you experience screen tearing; use G-Sync or FreeSync if available)
- **DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling)**: Quality or Performance (DLSS will significantly boost performance with minimal quality loss)
- **Ray Tracing**: Off (or set to Medium if you want to use it; ray tracing can be demanding even for a powerful GPU)
- **Texture Quality**: High (your 7800 XT should handle this with no issues)
- **Field of View**: Personal preference, typically around 80-100 for a good balance
- **Crowd Density**: Medium (can impact performance in heavy traffic areas)
- **Ambient Occlusion**: Medium or High (depends on performance)
- **Motion Blur**: Off (this is a personal preference but off will improve clarity)
- **Film Grain**: Off (to enhance visual sharpness)
- **Chromatic Aberration**: Off (improves clarity and reduces a visual effect that can be distracting)
- **Texture Filtering**: High or Ultra
- **Shadow Quality**: Medium or High (Ultra shadows can reduce performance, but High should be fine)
- **Reflection Quality**: High (adjust based on performance; reflections can be demanding)
- **Anisotropic Filtering**: 16x (for sharper textures at a distance with minimal performance cost)

### Advanced Settings (if needed):

- **Level of Detail (LOD)**: High (for better detail at a distance)
- **Screen Space Reflections**: Medium (or High if performance allows)
- **Light Shafts**: Medium or Low (can reduce performance)
- **Volumetric Fog**: Medium or Low (if you notice performance drops in fog-heavy areas)
- **Ray-Traced Reflections**: Off or Medium (if you enable ray tracing, this is one of the less demanding options)

### Other Tips:

- **FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR)**: If you're looking for even higher performance, consider enabling FSR in combination with DLSS or as an alternative.
- **NVIDIA Reflex (if using an NVIDIA GPU)**: This can lower input latency; however, as you're on an AMD GPU, it won't apply here.

These settings should give you a great balance of graphical fidelity and smooth performance at 1080p. If you experience performance drops, consider lowering some of the more demanding options like shadows and reflections.
