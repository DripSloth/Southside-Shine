#### Best weapon combo
SMG - AMR
AR - RAM7

In solos the SMG is really powerful


Buy a loadout (~$10,000) early. Top weapons for Area 99 include:

- Close Range: XM4 (AR) or PP-919 (SMG) for fast TTK in buildings.
    
- Long Range: LR 7.62 (sniper) or AMES 85 (AR) for open sightlines like Reactorâ€™s roof.

#### What keeps you alive

Knowing the map and winning the match


Come after cunts that are fighting eachother - boss move if you have the high ground is dropping in on their gunfight

Carry extra plates and a self-revive if possible.
#### Tips

Pop some shots first and take cover - they'll think you're running away - then pop straight back out

Don't need to stay around pop-off areas all the time

Find loot bags in areas - found on the ground. Need $7500 to retrieve loadout
